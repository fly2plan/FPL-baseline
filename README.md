# FPL-baseline

A demonstration of an AO and NM enacting the synchronisation and subsequent acceptance of an FPL by 'baselining' (see https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline).

Note that the 'session' key used in JSON requests of the postman collection is the id of a Socket.IO socket (see https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-socket-instance/)
